# InvestmentCalculator
This project creates a chart of your investment based on initial deposit, interest rate, years of investing and monthly investment amount.
It solves the problem of calculating this on your own or asking your bank. When creating this project, I made a very easy to use and well-made user interface. This code could probably be condensed more. But as of writing this I am not sure in which ways or how to do that. The hardest thing to program for this code was the correct outputs. Creating tables in C++.
I am satisfied with this program but would love for people to look over my code and suggest any improvements!

How to run/use:
Open in a terminal with GCC installed or Clang. Then you run it by creating a .exe file by doing:
Clang:
clang++ Calculator.cpp -o calc

or

GCC:
g++ Calculator.cpp -o calc

than typing:
./calc

Now you can insert the desired values and see the results.
Please message if you have any questions.
