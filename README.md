# InvestmentCalculator
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project creates a chart of your investment based on initial deposit, interest rate, years of investing and monthly investment amount.
It solves the problem of calculating this on your own, or asking your bank. When creating this project I made a very easy to use and well made user interface. This code could probably be condesed more. But as of writing this I am not sure in which ways or how to do that. The hardest thing to program for this code was the correct outputs. Creating tables in C++.
I am satisfied with this program but would love for people to look over my code and suggest any improvements!
